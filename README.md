`As this uses a little bit more resource for generating the screenshot so I could not make it work on free hosting. So, you can only use on your local machine fine.`

# Welcome to Code Screenshot Generator APP !

Hi! This is a **node.js** app for **generating screenshot of your code** in a macOS like window. Suppose you want to share a small snippet of code on a social media like Facebook, X (formally Twitter), LinkedIn etc,
Then you can use this app to generate a screenshot of your code so that you can easily share the image instead of raw code. Currently the code will appear in the screenshot as you format it. However, I will work on adding automatic formatting and automattic code highlighting later. This is the first version of the App for testing out.

## How to run the app.
1. Clone the repository on your computer
2. cd into the project root folder on your terminal eg. `cd code-screenshot`
3. Then run `npm install`
4. Then run `npm start`
5. Optional: For development purpose, you can run `npm run dev` and it will use nodemon to watch your changes. it is optional and development purpose only. You can skip this step to only use it.
6. Then browse `http:localhost:3000`
7. Paste and format your code and click on Generate Screenshot button and wait.
8. You will get your screenshot in a bit and you can save the screenshot.


## This app is free to use.
This app is free to use. If you do use it, then only a request that do not redistribute the code as if you own it. Rather share this repository link please and if possible then give this repository a star. Thank you :)
